Description:
This is a basic HTML project built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this project was to practice fundamental HTML structure and elements by creating a simple recipe webpage. The page includes sections for the recipe title, ingredients, and step-by-step cooking instructions. Almost none of CSS or JavaScript was used in this project, as the focus was solely on mastering the use of HTML tags and structure.

Key Features:

Basic HTML structure (headings, paragraphs, lists)
Semantic tags for better accessibility and SEO
Organized content with clear sectioning for easy readability
Learning Outcomes:

Understanding of basic HTML syntax and structure
Practice in creating well-formed, semantic HTML documents
Introduction to organizing content in a clear and logical manner
Next Steps:
In future projects, I plan to enhance this page with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, progressively building more complex and dynamic web pages.
